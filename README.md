SkillCraft Technology Data Science Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

"Objective"
The objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to explore survival patterns, identify key influencing factors, and visualize insights through data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

"Tools & Technologies"
  -> Jupyter Notebook → Environment for interactive analysis and visualization
  -> Python Libraries:
      Pandas → Data preprocessing, cleaning, and manipulation
      Matplotlib → Basic visualizations
      Seaborn → Advanced statistical visualizations
      Dataset → Titanic Survival dataset (Kaggle)

"Contents"
  -> titanic.csv → Dataset used for analysis (from Kaggle).
  -> Titanic_EDA.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing cleaning and EDA code.
  -> EDA_Visuals/ → Folder containing charts and plots generated during analysis.
    

"Dashboard (Notebook) Insights"
  -> Overall Survival: Only around 38% of passengers survived, while 62% did not.
  -> Gender Effect: Women had a much higher survival rate compared to men.
  -> Correlation Findings: Passenger class, fare, and gender showed the strongest correlation         with survival.

"Knowledge Gained"
  -> Practical understanding of data cleaning techniques (filling missing values, encoding             categorical features).
  -> Ability to apply EDA methods using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
  -> Learned how to create visualizations that tell a story about the data.
  -> Insights into how demographics and socio-economic status influenced Titanic survival.
  -> Experience combining statistical analysis with visualization to derive meaningful conclusions.

This project highlights the power of Python and Jupyter Notebook in performing end-to-end data analysis — from raw data preprocessing to generating actionable insights.
